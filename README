Replace all instance of DSE_MEM with the member number.
Using '93' as member ID as example here.



Installation:
=============
1. Create user 'forward'
	groupadd forward
	useradd forward -g forward
	passwd forward

2. Configure network interface
	netconfig
	  => IP: 150.1.93.24
	  => Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
	  => Default Gateway: 150.1.93.1

2. Configure, build and install the forwarder
	cd 00_forwarder.work.win
	make DSE_MEM=93
	make install
	cd ..

3. Go to '01_server-config/etc/' folder
	Edit '/etc/inittab' and '/etc/sysctl.conf' according to the files. Then
	type 'sysctl -p' to activate the forward rule.

	Go to 'ppp' folder and change all instances of 'DSE_MEM' with the
	member ID [93] used in Step 1 in all of the 'options.*' files. Then
	copy all files of the 'ppp' folder to '/etc/ppp/' folder.

	Go to 'mgetty+sendfax' folder and edit 'login.config' and
	'mgetty.config' files in '/etc/mgetty+sendfax/' folder.

4. Run 'ntsysv' and disable 'iptables' from service list. Because we're going
   to use our firewall rules.

5. Type 'telinit q' to reload '/etc/inittab' file. [optional if you restart]

Your server configuration is done.
Restart the system to see if everything works fine.

Client Configuration:
=====================
1. Go to '02_client-config' folder and replace all 'DSE_MEM' entries with member
   ID in 'forwarder.bat' file.
2. Run 'install.bat' file. Client configuration is done. Now enjoy using TESA.

from 'man pppd':
/etc/ppp/options.ttyname:
=========================
System default options for the serial port being used, read after ~/.ppprc. In
forming the 'ttyname' part of this filename, an initial '/dev/' is stripped
from the port name (if present), and any slashes in the remaining part are
converted to dots.

So, '/dev/pts/0' will be 'options.pts.0'


You may specify client ip from client side.
